# mac_amdgpu

A third-party native PCIDriverKit-based driver for AMD GPUs on macOS Tahoe
(26.x) running on Apple Silicon. The goal is to talk to a discrete AMD GPU
directly over PCIe — bypassing Metal entirely — by porting the relevant
slices of the Linux `amdgpu` kernel driver into a DriverKit system extension.

Primary target hardware is the **AMD Radeon AI PRO R9700** (RDNA4, gfx1201,
PCI `0x1002:0x7551`) connected via Thunderbolt 5 to an Apple Silicon Mac.
Other RDNA4 / gfx1201 cards should work with the same firmware images.

See [`docs/PORTING_NOTES.md`](docs/PORTING_NOTES.md) for the summary of how
this project diverges from upstream Linux `amdgpu` (memory model, IRQ model,
firmware loading, DART constraints, etc.).

## Status

**Phase 1B in progress.** The dext loads, attaches to a real R9700 over TB5,
and `IPDiscovery` + `PSPInit` have been confirmed against the real card.
Most of the GMC / RLC / CP / MES / SDMA bring-up chain is code-complete but
not yet exercised on hardware.

- `ROADMAP.md` — phase plan (0 through 4)
- `WORKLIST.md` — granular per-task state
- `docs/PORTING_NOTES.md` — divergences from Linux amdgpu

## Hardware requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac. Developed on M5 Pro / Max / Ultra; M1+ likely fine.
- Thunderbolt 5 to an external GPU enclosure. TB4 may work but is untested.
- AMD GPU: Radeon AI PRO R9700 (`0x1002:0x7551`). Other RDNA4 / gfx1201
  cards should work with the same firmware blobs.
- macOS **Tahoe 26.2** or newer.
- **SIP disabled.** The development entitlements we use require it. To
  disable: boot to Recovery (hold the power button on Apple Silicon),
  Utilities → Terminal, then:

  ```
  csrutil disable
  reboot
  ```

## Software requirements

- Xcode 26 or newer, with DriverKit SDK 25.4+.
- Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`.
- `xcodegen` (`brew install xcodegen`).
- A paid Apple Developer Program membership with one specific entitlement
  request granted (see below).
- `linux-firmware` microcode blobs for the R9700 (sourced separately).

## Apple Developer Portal setup

1. Create an **App ID** for the host app: `<your-prefix>.MacAMDGPUHost`
   (e.g. `com.yourname.MacAMDGPUHost`). Enable the **System Extension**
   capability.

2. Create an **App ID** for the dext:
   `<your-prefix>.MacAMDGPUHost.MacAMDGPU`. The dext bundle id MUST be a
   child of the host bundle id with the suffix `.MacAMDGPU`. Enable the
   **DriverKit** capability, then under "Configure" enable both of:

   - **DriverKit Transport (PCI)** — request either
     `0xFFFFFFFF&0x00000000` (full wildcard) or `0x1002:0x7551`
     (R9700-specific) as the `IOPCIPrimaryMatch`. Apple grants the
     development entitlement through the portal request flow, usually
     within a few hours.
   - **DriverKit Allow Any UserClient Access** — also Apple-granted, also
     quick.

3. Download the two **Development** provisioning profiles for these App IDs.
   Xcode automatic signing pulls them down for you if you sign in.

4. Note your 10-character **Team ID** from Apple Developer → Membership.

## Team ID and bundle ID renaming

The repo ships pinned to team `YBQ9BU6Q6F` and bundle prefix
`com.geramyloveless`. To use your own:

- Override the team ID via environment for builds:

  ```
  export XCODE_TEAM_ID=YOURTEAMID
  ```

- Change the bundle prefix by editing:
  - `project.yml` — search for `com.geramyloveless` and replace.
  - `Host/MacAMDGPUHostApp.swift` — the `dextBundleIdentifier` constant.

  The host bundle id and the dext bundle id MUST form a parent/child pair
  where the dext id is exactly `<host id>.MacAMDGPU`.

## Firmware blob setup

The dext needs AMD microcode blobs from `linux-firmware` for the first PM4
("Hello GFX12") milestone:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git ~/linux-firmware
```

Required files (all under `amdgpu/` in linux-firmware):

| File                    | Purpose                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `psp_14_0_3_sos.bin`    | PSP SOS bootloader               |
| `smu_14_0_3.bin`        | Power management (PMFW)          |
| `sdma_7_0_1.bin`        | SDMA microcode                   |
| `gc_12_0_1_rlc.bin`     | RLC microcode                    |
| `gc_12_0_1_imu.bin`     | Image Management Unit            |
| `gc_12_0_1_pfp.bin`     | CP — Prefetch Parser             |
| `gc_12_0_1_me.bin`      | CP — Micro Engine                |
| `gc_12_0_1_mec.bin`     | CP — Microcode Engine Compute    |
| `gc_12_0_1_uni_mes.bin` | MES scheduler (unified)          |

Copy these into a directory of your choice. At runtime, the host app's
"Pick Firmware Folder…" button points the dext at that directory.

## Build + install

```
git clone git@github.com:lemonade-sdk/mac-amdgpu.git
cd mac-amdgpu
export XCODE_TEAM_ID=YOURTEAMID
scripts/build.sh
```

`scripts/build.sh` runs `xcodegen` then `xcodebuild`, producing
`MacAMDGPUHost.app` under DerivedData. The script prints the
`BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR` path at the end.

### Post-build resign (required)

The dext must be re-signed with **minimal** entitlements so AMFI honors
`allow-any-userclient-access` (see "Code-signing gotchas" below). Apple
Development signing normally bakes in `get-task-allow` and
`application-identifier`, which silently disqualify restricted DriverKit
entitlements. You must strip them by re-signing the dext post-build:

```bash
BUILT=$(xcodebuild -showBuildSettings -scheme MacAMDGPUHost -configuration Debug \
  | awk '/ BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR / {print $3}')
DEXT="$BUILT/MacAMDGPUHost.app/Contents/Library/SystemExtensions/com.yourprefix.MacAMDGPUHost.MacAMDGPU.dext"

cat > /tmp/dext_entitlements.plist <<'EOF'
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

EOF

codesign --force --sign "Apple Development: Your Name (XXXXXXXXXX)" \
  -o library,runtime \
  --entitlements /tmp/dext_entitlements.plist \
  "$DEXT"

codesign --force --sign "Apple Development: Your Name (XXXXXXXXXX)" \
  --entitlements Host/Host.entitlements \
  "$BUILT/MacAMDGPUHost.app"
```

### Install + activate

```
sudo systemextensionsctl developer on
cp -R "$BUILT/MacAMDGPUHost.app" /Applications/
open /Applications/MacAMDGPUHost.app
```

The host app submits an activation request on launch. macOS will prompt to
approve in **System Settings → General → Login Items & Extensions →
Driver Extensions** — toggle MacAMDGPU on. Afterwards,
`systemextensionsctl list` should show the entry as `* * activated enabled`.

## Run the bring-up

The host app window has a row of test buttons
(**Ping** / **Identity** / **BARs** / **Query**) plus a
"**Bringup stages**" ladder. Click them in order. The log pane shows
results. Before the `LoadSOS+...` step, click "**Pick Firmware Folder…**"
and choose the directory containing the firmware blobs above.

## Entitlement reference

| Entitlement | Bundle | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `com.apple.developer.system-extension.install` | host | Required to call `OSSystemExtensionRequest`. Granted automatically by Apple when you enable System Extension capability on the host App ID. |
| `com.apple.developer.driverkit` | dext | Required for any DriverKit dext. Apple-granted. |
| `com.apple.developer.driverkit.transport.pci` | dext | Permits attaching to PCI devices matching the listed `IOPCIPrimaryMatch`. **Requires Apple to approve the specific match scope via the portal.** Wildcard is fine for development; production needs a narrower scope. |
| `com.apple.developer.driverkit.allow-any-userclient-access` | dext | Lets any client app open the user client. Without it, every client app needs `com.apple.developer.driverkit.userclient-access` listing this dext. Apple-granted. |

## Code-signing gotchas

These four surprises eat most of an afternoon if you don't know about them.

1. **Sign the dext with `-o library,runtime`** (flags `0x12000`). Without
   the `library` flag, AMFI silently strips restricted DriverKit
   entitlements and `IOServiceOpen` returns
   `kIOReturnNotPermitted (0xe00002e2)`.

2. **The dext's signed entitlements must not contain `get-task-allow` or
   `application-identifier`.** Apple Development signing normally bakes
   those in. Re-sign the dext post-build with a minimal entitlements plist
   (see the resign script above).

3. **The host app must not have hardened runtime enabled.**
   `IOServiceOpen` against your own dext returns `kIOReturnNotPermitted`
   if hardened runtime is on.

4. **The dext bundle's filename must equal its `CFBundleIdentifier`**
   (Apple bug FB15590713). `project.yml` pins
   `PRODUCT_NAME = PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` on the dext target to
   enforce this. If you rename the bundle, both must change together.

## Troubleshooting

- **`kr=0xe00002e2 kIOReturnNotPermitted` from `IOServiceOpen`** — re-sign
  the dext with the minimal entitlements (gotchas #1 and #2), and confirm
  hardened runtime is off on the host (#3).
- **"Extension not found in App bundle"** — check that the dext filename
  matches its bundle id (gotcha #4), and that the dext is at
  `Contents/Library/SystemExtensions/<bundle-id>.dext` inside the host app.
- **"no policy, cannot allow apps outside /Applications"** in the `sysextd`
  log — the host app isn't in `/Applications/`, or its bundle name doesn't
  match the dext bundle name pattern. Copy the app to `/Applications/` and
  retry.
- **Live debugging:**

  ```
  log stream --predicate 'process == "sysextd" OR (eventMessage CONTAINS "DK:")'
  ```

## Project layout

- `Host/` — SwiftUI host app that drives the dext.
- `dext/` — the DriverKit system extension (C++ inside an IOService).
- `project.yml` — xcodegen spec; regenerates `MacAMDGPU.xcodeproj`.
- `scripts/` — build, install, and ping/test helpers.
- `docs/` — porting notes, Apple-VFIO reference notes, AS/DART limit
  cheat-sheets, and the phase-by-phase port plans.
- `upstream/` — vendored Linux + Mesa source for reference. Gitignored.
- `firmware/` — local firmware staging. Gitignored.
